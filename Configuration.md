#ConfigurationIn order to execute a phenotype, the following information is needed.  All of these details are contained in an “ExecutionConfiguration” object.  Sub-sections listed below have more details about parts of the overall execution configuration.* Value Set Location – configuration option for how value sets are discovered.  Allowed values are to use local files (1) or CTS2 repositories (2).  At this time you cannot combine local files and CTS2.* Value Sets – see sub-section below.  This represents a list of 1 or more value set endpoints to be used for the phenotype.* Execution Engine Name – which engine is to be used for this execution.  Instead of using an enum, a string value is used to represent the class name of the execution engine to use.* Execution Return – the expected result of the execution engine.  Allowed values are just to return counts (1) or to return a list of patients (2).* Execution Mode – defines how the execution engine progress through the query.  The allowed values account for an optimized query (1), or a debugging query that steps through each data and logical element (2).* Execution Engine Configuration – the specific configuration details needed for the execution engine to operate.  Additional details are provided in the Execution Engine sub-section below for the engines supported by PhEx.  Other engines may be added, with their own configuration details.
##Value SetsThis will define the details of the value set endpoint.  These will change depending on the type of value set location selected.###Local Value Sets* File Path – the path of the file containing the value set definitions.* Format – how the value set definitions are structured.  Allowed values include (TBD – will include stuff like CVS and Excel files for CTS2, VSAC, etc.)###CTS2 Value Sets* Base URL – the base URL to the CTS2 repository.* Login – if required, an account login for the CTS2 repository.* Password – if required, an account password for the CTS2 repository.##Execution Engine### I2B2
* Project Management URL - the URL of the i2b2 Project Management (PM) cell
* Login - a login in the i2b2 system that has permissions to execute queries
* Password - the password for the i2b2 account
* Project - the name of the i2b2 project to run against
* Domain - the i2b2 domain to run against
